## Blockworld

My goal is to use this already good written engine and mechanics to create a different kind of game.

MMO with infinte world PvP where every player is kind of a mage and has different spells.

This will be a lot of work. If you like this and want to contribute just let me know!

TODOS

* Update player models, make them actually walk and jump accordingly.
* Init player health, death and respawn (near to other players if present)
* Init spells (weapons) - thought of ballistic spells with nice effects, like firespell and limited reach
* Add main game menue for new game, join server etc. Also would invoke master server listing later
* Add some sound effects (jump, walk, ambient, spells, death and respawn)
* Maybe add scoreboard to see the current scores
* Generate Buildings and other stuff once in a while procedural
* Make world actually darker at night (lightning fix)
* Add background music (not too loud) - introduce OpenAL to the game or so
* Add stars and moon to night
* Add sun(sunlight)


This will be a total conversion of [Fogleman's Craft](https://github.com/fogleman/Craft) 

Also please see there (at least for now) for instructions.
